# OTT Dashboard Project 

## Overview

The project was to create an interactive dashboard which displayed a dataset based upon amazon prime viewership. This would allow insight into tv ratings, viewership insight, imdb ratings, geographical data. The dataset was taken from Kaggle. The application:

* Allows the user to view various analytics of the amazon prime viewership and records. 
* Provides user with the IMDb rating trends over the years, along with visulisation on age restriction categories.
* Provides a interface for the user to perform filtering and quering operations on the dataset under use.
* Finally, provides the user with the geographical representation of the distribution of movie origins around the world.



## Tools used

* R, Shiny and Shiny Dashboard
* Plotly
* dplyr and ggplot2
* HTML5 and CSS3
* JavaScript 
* Python (Data Cleaning)
* RStudio



## Salient Features
* Creating a user-friendly UX using ShinyDashboard
* Presenting information using R and Shiny
* Incorporating various data visulatization concepts (Taught in Class) into a Shiny application
* Manipulating data to produce final metrics
* Deployment of the R project


## Challenges

* Creating dynamic widgets that react to user input
* Applying bootstrap principles to a shiny app (grid attributes, fluidRow)
* Wrangling data using dplyr (select, filter, arrange, summarise) to populate graphs accurately
* Rendering interactive charts effectively
